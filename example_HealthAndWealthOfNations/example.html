<p>This is a recreation in <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> of Gapminder’s <a href="http://gapminder.org/world/">Wealth &amp; Health of Nations</a>, made famous by Hans Rosling’s memorable <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">2006 TED talk</a>. It shows the dynamic fluctuation in per-capita income (<i>x</i>), life expectancy (<i>y</i>) and population (area) of 180 nations over the last 209 years. Nations are colored by geographic region; mouseover to read their names.</p>
